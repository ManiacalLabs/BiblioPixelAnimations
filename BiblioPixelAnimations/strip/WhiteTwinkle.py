#  ## WhiteTwinkle ##
# This Bibliopixel animation randomly picks leds and slowly brightens them to a max brightness
# then dims them to off.

# Author: Bob Steinbeiser, based on work by Mark Kriegsman at:

#
#  ## Usage ##
#
#  max_led -    The max number of pixels you want used ('None' for all leds)
#  speed   -    How fast the leds bighten then dim (best in range 2-40)
#  density -    The density (or number) of twinkling leds
#  max_bright - The maximum brightness, some leds twinkle better if they ramp to less than full
#                 brightness (19 - 255). Lower brightness also speeds up the twinkle rate.
